# Hip-Hop-aholik

This is an iOS app written in Swift. The name of the app is Hip-Hop-aholik. 

This app aims to provide the latest news about hip-hop, introduction of hip-hop artists and related songs to people who love hip-hop. 

The app uses APIs of NPR Music to get access to the latest hiphop news, those of Youtube to get access to music videos and wiki videos, and those of Wikipedia to get access to introductions.
